## Instructions

All pictures can be generated by simply running `main.py`. The code assumes that `main.py` is in the same directory as the `data` subdirectory, which should contain all of the raw input files. `main.py` will iterate through the listed input file names and run the alignment algorithm on each one. The script also requires that `utils.py` is in the same directory, as the majority of the functionality is imported from this file.
